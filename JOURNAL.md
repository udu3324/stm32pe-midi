# June 6th: Sketching out the idea

Today, I started researching the components that I would depend on. (stm32 ecosystem, i2c multiplexers, sensors) I then created some technical sketches of the device and drew some core concepts. 

Feature Set
 - Recognizable by Ableton (or any general DAW software)
 - Sends mpe midi (duh)
 - USB-C connection for flashing & otg device
 - (optional) 3.5mm jack for int. synth engine
 - Cool rgb indicators

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6459d8a0-7505-47d1-8316-bf31698aa046)

Components Needed
 - **STM32H7**43VIH (great mcu, bga style needing multilayer pcb fab)
 - TMAG5273 - I2C hall effect sensor
 - TCA9548A - For multiplexing i2c connections
 - Possibly SDRAM for an internal synth engine
 - IO Ports, Encoder
 - other smd components


**Total time spent: ~3 hours**

# June 8th: Getting the TMAG5273 to work

The core idea of this controller was to use a hall effect sensor (tmag5273) to measure the position of a magnet and output many things out of it. Before continuing any further, I need to make sure that it works.

## Wiring

Two resources were used in wiring the sensor. I looked at the [datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmag5273.pdf) first to get an idea of the pinout and reference circuit, as well as how sparkfun implemented it through their board [here](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_Qwiic_Hall_Effect_Sensor_TMAG5273/assets/board_files/schematic-mini.pdf). 

I decided for now to use my [esp32 devkit](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32s3/esp32-s3-devkitc-1) to test out the sensor before switching to the stm32 ecosystem.

The INT pin for disabling the sensor was left unconnected, SDA and SCL to any GPIO with a 4.7k pullup resistor, and VCC to 3.3V. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82824afd-b3b3-41d3-bf74-3a4f5ccb9313)

## Code

I am using PlatformIO's VSC plugin to flash and test everything. The first thing to flash was a simple [I2C device scanner](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-i2c-communication-arduino-ide) to see if I had everything wired correctly. This process took quite long as I did not know if the sensor was fried or if my wiring was horrible. (it was both ðŸ˜­)

I can then move onto [sparkfun's library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_TMAG5273_Arduino_Library) to communicate with the tmag sensor.

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include "SparkFun_TMAG5273_Arduino_Library.h" 

TMAG5273 sensor;

uint8_t i2cAddress = 0x35;

const int ledPin = 17;  // GPIO 17
const int I2C_SDA = 4;
const int I2C_SCL = 5;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(1000);
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  // Set GPIO 17 as an output
  Wire.begin(I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL);

  Serial.println("hello world");

  // If begin is successful (0), then start example
  if (sensor.begin(i2cAddress, Wire) == 1) {
    Serial.println("Begin");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Device failed to setup - Freezing code.");
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Checks if mag channels are on - turns on in setup
  if (sensor.getMagneticChannel() != 0) {
    sensor.setTemperatureEn(true);

    float magX = sensor.getXData();
    float magY = sensor.getYData();
    float magZ = sensor.getZData();
    float temp = sensor.getTemp();

    //Serial.printf("( %7.2f, %7.2f, %7.2f ) mT   %6.2f C\n", magX, magY, magZ, temp);
    
    Serial.printf("%f,%f,%f,%f\n", magX, magY, magZ, temp);
    //relative to dot on ic facing forward to viewer
    // left-right, forward-backward, up-down
  } else {
    Serial.println("Mag Channels disabled, stopping..");
  }

  delay(50);
}
```

# June 9th: Designing the flexures for the keys

I started off on a new page and drew two concepts of how I could implement [flexures](https://web.mit.edu/mact/www/Blog/Flexures/FlexureIndex.html) in a key. It would allow me to build the device with less parts with the same functionality, as well as saving on money. The print layers also had to be thought of to make sure flexing won't compromise on durability and break. 

Below is some rough sketches of how the keys would look like and how it would come together with the pcb. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45038e86-c804-486a-84d6-df553b95d1cc)

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

# June 10th: Cadding and 3d printing key prototypes

I decided that I'll choose the more simpler key with only one model that i need to create. I am using Fusion 360 to accomplish this with their personal plan.

Key Requirements (ahaha get it)
 - Fits a 5mm cube neodymium magnet
 - Flexes easily, doesn't strain fingers
 - Can flex in all the neccesary axis
 - Use little to no extra plastic when printing

## Prototype V1

![v1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73cd9562-37d2-4ac5-a7ac-75ec2b59992d)

This was the first prototype to kickstart my idea of a key. I started off with a side sketch and extruded it, then adding features in the other dimension. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/819f46e1-ac3f-4cde-a41d-1ba0ac762de0)

Well.. It did not turn out great the first try, and of course it would never be perfect the first try. I designed the flexure to be too thin and it wouldn't hold up the upper weight of the key. It also could not fit the magnet.

Instead of it flexing left or right, the key decided to rotate in place which i did not intend to. But wait... This gave me a new **game breaking** idea! Instead of+ designing it to move in two axises, I can just have it move in one axis and rotate in place which can also be measured by the sensor! It is something so unique that I could have never thought of without this prototype. 

## Protype V2

![v2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/404164a9-7ace-402b-8909-9496b2a2501b)

This second prototype solved many problems of the first one. It finally held the magnet, its own weight, and almost has the rotation action perfect.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/697a05ec-768d-458f-8234-b37619ebfad9)

The only two problems now is that it is a bit stiff for a key on a midi keyboard as well as something I didn't think about for fabrication. Pressing it all the way down while trying to rotate it scrapes the layer lines making an irritating noise. 

## Prototype V3

![v3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b5caa83-9d4c-4ef3-8dd3-1ef0b61ddda2)

This prototype solved the issue of the key being too stiff. It requires less force to push down now, but still has the scraping problem which I'm not sure how to solve. I'll do that later lol.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a570f237-cc6d-4073-9218-a842fe3393ff)

The data isn't as smooth as i hoped, but I think thats an issue in the code. The white line looking like a sine wave is the rotation movement of the key.

**Total time spent: 5 hours** (2 hrs of printing)

# June 11-13th: Prototyping the smaller keys

I decided that there would be a smaller version of a key for the sharps and flats on the controller. It seemed easy at first until changing the length of a key would mean tweaking every other aspect of the flexure endlessly.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eff6605-5d60-4495-8d86-32789546f280)

A total of 13 prototypes were printed. Many problems were faced, including but not limited to.... low durability, permanent deformation, too much pressure to push down, no springines, and my lack of knowledge in making flexures. Although I chose aesthetics over functionality, I think everything will turn out great. 

**Total time spent: 2.5 hours** (accumulated, not including hours of printing)

# June 16th: Creating board schematics

I started working on the schematics for the board to bring all the components I need together.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b095556-8960-4b0f-af6c-f5bf798f5661)

So far, I have been following the [power supply scheme](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32h743vi.pdf) from the stm32 datasheet as well as researching some other sources. I chose KiCad to build my board in as it is free and an amazing open source tool. 

I still need to add some sort of fuse to the VBUS of the usb-c to protect against esd, as well as my sensors, leds, possibly a dac with audio out, and most definitely a button to allow flashing firmware to the mcu. 

**Total time spent: 3 hours**

# June 17th: Adding the rest

The boot and reset button needed to flash firmware was added as well as some useful indicator LEDs.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0315bbd-7b02-414f-bda3-ee53db0c141b)

I decided to create a sub-sheet to fit all my sensors on another page. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c5f274c-731e-438f-b1e3-1929e54cbb0a)

**Total time spent: 3 hours**

# June 18th: Working on cad assembly

I decided that I would bring everything together to then model the size of the pcb to then take into KiCad. Currently, I am only familiar with OnShape's assembly feature and have no clue how it will go. 

![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21fadf20-c203-47ec-8d2b-428e16d82cbf)

It went horrible of course. I tried editing my sub-assemblies to add a pcb groove but kept on running into so many issues. It took many sketches and saving/syncing issues until I finally was able to modify parts across f3d projects without f**king everything up. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4159961d-e60d-4a9c-8dc8-1cdc8b276737)

I made sure to include a 0.15mm gap which would hopefully allow some tolerance for the pcb to fit. (Â±0.2mm for shape, Â±10% for thickness) It would also create a friction fit for the board as well.

**Total time spent: 4 hours**

# June 20th: Adding leds + more

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba1aeb4b-c904-42d8-9c17-c02ffc613f8d)

I had to multiplex my leds to use less io on the stm32. The TLC5940 seemed like the best fit for me as it was pwm and would be nice if each key would have some sort of power indicator. 

I also used KiCad's feature of assigning every symbol to a footprint. I decided on every capacitor and resistor having the same package size (0805/2012 metric) and it being not microscopic in case of any repairs and to simplify the bom.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de164a9-6b1b-45ac-ab16-cbfdafc9685d)

I decided to add a way to output audio. It uses a MCP4922 and two LM396s to allow simple, not audiophile quality, audio delivery to the user.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b55f5278-1351-45b6-abc9-be991cfdd276)

I was able to test a more simplified/mono design of the audio circuit some time ago with the parts I got from high seas.

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

# June 22th: Cadding plate + pcb layout

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c715d33-bfa5-4c9b-983a-5dedf1defa2b)

I finished up the plate/thing that would hold everything together. So far, most things are press fit into place while the main board uses m3 screws.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/794ea05e-b816-4f78-b141-f46df08ebbc2)

I had no clue what i was getting myself into. Everything is laid out with the proper resistors or capacitors next to each other, but its a super dense board which creates a whole list of other challenges.

It was a pain trying to get everything to fit in the first place. I had to remove two extra leds, remove the entire audio output circuit (rip..), redo some schematics, and contemplate my life choices. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcb35233-848d-4590-a504-67ed48e1d579)

All that's needed left is to route all the traces and place the pullup resistors for the sda/scl lines, as well as calculating the amount of headers i need for the wires between the three boards.

**Total time spent: 7 hours**

# June 23th + 24th: Unseen Constraints - Routing All Traces

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a1312ef-efad-41c4-9509-1b6b9fc4b3fa)

I should have thought of the size of my board before doing anything. That was my hugest mistake. I was constrainted to the size/shape of my board which I never thought of while cadding only until now after some work was done.

I had to...

 - remove some features
 - resize the board to fit some components
 - constantly mess around with previous traces (because past me did not think about the future)
 - edit the heat spreader of the led multiplexer to be smaller which is kinda sus but who cares lol
 - cope

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2c604a-bf54-4533-8c70-40bc96dfeb13)

In the end, I managed to get everything wired up. KiCad still yells about certain things being unconnected as well as a list of other stuff that isnt really important. I'm really proud of the work as this is a new high for me.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82984a8d-efe5-418b-a55d-c17eee4ce423)

While 80% done tracing everything, I decided to export the pcb to jlcpcb to see how much it would cost so far. It was priced around ~$140 USD for assembling two boards. I then clicked checkout and... I forgot there was tariffs going on right now.. (totaling around $230)

**Total time spent: ~14 hours**

# June 25th: Final touches + more

![kicad_t1TWV0PZLa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e8a43e9-ccc3-492c-bd33-839026a96d45)

After routing everything, I made sure i had no critical errors by using KiCad's design rule checker (DRC for short). It revealed a ton of problems like unconnected grounds, traces, and more. Although some components were marked as too close to others, it was only by a little and i could safely ignore it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bb56d30-c393-4b80-9bf8-0e8923adb3f5)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95bb8321-62ed-454d-83b1-672675b4ce6b)

I have no clue how i didn't notice this at all. I placed my sensor in the wrong place and only found out last second. It wasn't a pain to move though.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a87f269d-1335-4bd0-a22c-23cade6d2a16)

Here's the actual final final look of the pcb. It is amazing.

**Total time spent: 3 hours**

# MILESTONE: MY PROJECT WAS SUBMITTED AND APPROVED HERE

This log is to just seperate my prep and building phase.

**Total time spent: 0 hours**

# July 7th: 3d-printing the Case

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0db859af-bacf-4a99-a2ae-63309275f82a)

My 3d printer was a bit too small to actually print the entire case in one piece, so i instead designed a clip system to piece it together.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d049158-9270-468b-a362-87c050a98077)

The first attempt was a bit too tight, so I used fusion 360's variable parameter features to easily change one number and retry.

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

# July 8th: Actually 3d printing the case and assembling it

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b75b0dd-cb3b-4573-9ef7-fa2d3737fab6)

It was perfect. I did some post processing to remove some strands as well as pla left behind by prusaslicer's ironing feature.

I used the uv glue to keep everything together permanently. I repurposed a old uv nail lamp to cure the glue.

**Total time spent: 3 hours**

# July 9th: The boards have arrived!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51c9a90c-b560-4112-9a94-e8af5f509300)

The boards needed some preprocessing as well as some components had to be hand soldered on.

I used a dremel to seperate the sensor board from the main board and tried my best not to breathe in any of the toxic fibers.

**Total time spent: 5 hours**

# July 10th: Soldering + 3d Printing More Stuff

<img width="498" height="506" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/912c7280-c8f9-4c09-893f-784bca187018" />

The board needed to have some male/female headers soldered on as well as buttons too. That was the easy part. I now needed to solder header wires to extremely small/close together pads on the right side. I ended up ripping a pad off while doing this somehow. ðŸ˜­ Good thing JLCPCB has a minimum two PCBA boards so I can start over.

I also printed most of the white keys and did some post processing of them. (removing some pla stuck to the sides of the print after the ironing stage)


<img width="1000" height="528" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d703096-08a7-4922-9ee7-ee5a1cc07114" />

I tried powering on the board but the power led was not on!!! There is no way i designed this to be nonfunctional. I whipped out my multimeter to see where voltage wasn't flowing, and saw that one of my safety capacitors for something was the main culprit.

<img width="221" height="135" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9622835-3966-4d2a-800e-01705401f2ab" />

I fucked up. I tried removing this with a soldering iron on my board thinking it would evenly melt both pads. It ripped one off. Good thing surface tension is a thing though, as it magically created a new pad for me and bridged them together.

# July 11th: Time to go to Undercity!!!

My project made me eligible to go to undercity!! It's my first time ever doing a hackathon so i am a bit nervous. 

**Total time spent: 0 hours**

# July 16th: Printing more stuff

<img width="598" height="495" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12275d82-f07c-4335-829a-f04c25b2f058" />

I printed out the rest of my black keys. Nothing was done much today as i was still recovering from undercity lol.

**Total time spent: 30 minutes**

# July 17th: Fitting things together

<img width="1148" height="324" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86bce8a1-248f-4197-bd6e-8d8d6ae966d0" />

My tolerances are... a bit too tight. In the picture above, you can see all of the white keys installed. They press fit together with the case, but do it too much. It caused the case to bend and overall make it a bit longer. This is horrible as there are also tolerances on the pcb which make it impossible to fit with an extra milimeter.

I managed to fix this by sanding down some of the keys that seem too big.

Also seen in the image above, some of the keys seem a little janky/bent. This is because I was postprocessing it and left it in a hot car.

**Note to self: DO NOT LEAVE 3D PRINTS IN A CAR ON A HOT SUMMER DAY**

<img width="317" height="238" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d4626fe-747a-4307-9b08-d78765364ab1" />

I bought the wrong size magnets. (also they seem kind of less strong but its ok i think) They should press fit in but its too loose and i am forced to super glue each and every one of them. I should have only printed one to see if the fit was perfect for the magnets i bought instead of the magnets i had on hand.

**NOTE TO FUTURE SELF: print one thing at a time to see if it actually fits before printing/processing it all**

For some reason though, there was a press fit on the black keys but not white. This is really strange as i am pretty sure both have the same dimension cut out.

**Total time spent: 6 hours**

# July 18th: It's finally built!! + starting on firmware

<img width="1159" height="802" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79936e72-c411-442e-9ba1-f927504a8486" />

The tolerances were so tight. I did not add them all up and did not leave enough wiggle room for myself. It all worked out in the end though, as for some reason, all my leds are on without any code to trigger them. Nice.

<img width="1881" height="940" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-18 200207" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d86ae589-b41b-4653-8331-a38e55153fe7" />

I am using a combination of STM32's programmer and cube ide to get things started. The UI for setting things up is really nice, but I am still getting used to the workflow. 

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

# July 20th: Learning the ways of STM32CubeIDE/CubeMX 

I have never coded c/cpp before, but do have java experience. It is a little different with c header files, but it all worked out okay in the end.

<img width="789" height="397" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/050928e5-8b84-4977-95d1-f7bc9e315b95" />

I was able to sucessfully implement my TLC5940 ics that multiplex all the LEDs for each keys. It was a pain as I really had no clue what i was doing, as well as the weird way i implemented them.

<img width="1341" height="517" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857a23f7-dd7a-4827-9f1c-9896f04fca85" />

There are two ics connected together with both having a different amount of leds. It is such a weird implementation that took so much trial and error from both me and uhh.. ai.. to get to finally work. The most important helper function now is the premapped one which makes interaction with them extremely easy.

```c
void TLC5940_SetMappedLED(uint8_t logical_index, uint16_t brightness) {
	static const uint8_t mapping_table[10] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };

	uint8_t physical_index;

	if (logical_index < 10) {
		physical_index = mapping_table[logical_index];
	} else if (logical_index >= 10 && logical_index <= 25) { // 10â€“25 to physical 16â€“31
		physical_index = logical_index + 6;
	} else {
		return;
	}

	TLC5940_SetLED(physical_index, brightness);
}
```

# July 21st: Initializing the TCA9548A

I found a good [library](https://github.com/jtainer/i2c-mux) from jtainer that can handle my multiplexer for my i2c devices. The only problem now that i need to change the addresses on my TMAG5273s as they are all the same.

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

# July 22nd: Getting the TMAG5273 to work

I found a neat little [library](https://github.com/devOramaMan/stm32_TMAG5273) from devOramaMan that implements the hall effect sensor to work with the stm32 hal.

I tried getting the y axis values and mapping it to my pwm leds, but of course, it did not work first try. I should have designed some sort of uart connection to my board but had to go with setting up a virtual com port device.

<img width="927" height="530" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54f27def-3053-404a-ab29-47e1f3b20257" />

I had no clue what i was getting myself into. All these steps led me to this. It took so long troubleshooting why it didn't show up in my taskbar as a USB device. Turns out.. It shouldnt! It shows up only in device manager in a hidden dropdown that i didnt even know that existed.

**Total time spent: 6 hours**

# July 23rd: TMAG5273 Pain

I am now experiencing even more issues. Either I am not using the library correctly or i2c is running directly over the com port communications and interrupting anything from going through.

There is a bunch of troubleshooting I've done that has gotten me little steps closer. I just have no clue what to do.

Currently on this commit, everything just gives up and freezes on the `TMAG5273_Init(&tmag);` line. I am losing all my hairs.

**Total time spent: 7 hours**

# July 24th: A light from the dark

<img width="862" height="322" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c3403df-9ab4-4fd6-b0f5-bd3ec7d194d0" />

I have found a discord server dedicated to the stm32 ecosystem. I immediately wrote a forum post to them about my issue, being very informative as possible. A kind person gave me the best resource I've ever seen.

[stm32world.com](https://stm32world.com/wiki/Serial_Debugging)

Turns out, something was wrong with me casually writing to cdc everytime to send a debug message over. Instead, they have a nice cookie cutter function that replaces `printf()` to make my debugging actually work. A huge thanks to their community.

I can now focus on my original problem of getting my i2c sensor device to be recognized and parsed. (foreshadowing: it was painful)

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

# July 27th: Finally getting my hall effect sensors working

It took so much trial and error to get **one** sensor working. Turns out, the library I use had some problems with the device id. (in TMAG5273_ReadMagneticField) I don't have  much experience in i2c devices, and i also kind of have a deadline, so i resulted to using two AIs to help me solve this issue.

It took me about 15+ chats on chatgpt, 50+ lines of debugging, and a switch to Github Copilot to give better context. The final result was about 10 lines of code to fix the external library I found.

I can finally now move onto trying to rewrite the addresses of each tmag as they aren't unique and will cause i2c communication conficts.

I bought all of the A1 models which have all the same address. I read in the datasheet originally that they were editable so i thought it was fine, but i think it might be a bit hard. It also is a money saving technique i used as each model would count as an extended part, about 4+ usd for each model.

Why did Texas Instruments design their sensors like this?

# July 28th: Working on midi protocol

I did further research and found out that I bricked my own board. I can't rewrite the tmag's address as it will be targeting all of the i2c devices of that same address, and will overwrite the ones that I don't want. Welp, that sucks.

I decided to work on the midi instead and implemented [TinyUSB](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) to help me turn it into a recognizable midi device.

This [github discussion](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/discussions/633) was a massive help in doing it, and it was pretty easy compared to writing my own custom device class implementation through [HAL](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/546927). Although, I should probably learn it the hard way for the future.

I finally got midi to be generated from my board!!! But.. It is inconsistant.

Turns out, the midi test function i used has a hal_delay which runs in the func > while loop > main.c which blocks all other things from running. It was fixed by using the HAL ticking function to avoid sleeping.

# July 29th: First functional key!!!

<img width="670" height="207" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 183725" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ca1a4b1-0bbd-41dc-b91e-4bbd595dd19a" />

The triggering of a key was pretty easy. It was a different story for the velocity though. All i needed was to parse the sensor's distance and have cutoffs to trigger midi notes being on and off. For the velocity, It was the measurement in how much distance changed over time. A distance that occured in a shorter amount of time would have more velocity, while a longer time would have less velocity.

Recording the output midi worked perfectly, and I made sure the code could be scalable to the rest of the 24 keys.

# July 30th: SMD Soldering

So i bought a hotplate but it did not come with a charger brick for powering it with 20V 3A. I improvised by using my bench powersupply, usb-c breakout, and my phone charger cable to make it all work last second. (all of these came from hack club funding, tysm!!! well, not the cable)

I had to use my hot air gun as well as my hot plate to remove and replace my sensors. It was pretty easy removing them! It was the opposite for replacing them...

These ic chips are so small and I don't have any extras as they all cost about a dollar each. I dropped two and gave myself two heart attacks.

I used my tweezers to do everything. I do not own a solder paste stencil/syringe, just a tub of it. I had to shape the solder paste onto the sot-23 pads and it was horrible.

After soldering, I made sure everything was connected and nothing was bridged with a multimeter.

# July 31st: Getting all the keys to work

<img width="805" height="507" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-31 224251" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db50b3bd-c73b-4bd9-af96-953f0a6135d4" />

I went with the approach of getting all the i2c channels being combined together through my mux. This would be better than looping through all six of them which possibly could slow down my main loop.

To do this, I would have to give all my sensors unique addresses. This is because my fix from yesterday made all the sensors unique in one channel, but that channel's addresses are the same from the other channels.

The library i found for the TMAG5273 does not have a function to rewrite i2c addresses, so I had to make one somehow.

```c
uint8_t TMAG5273_RewriteI2CAddress(TMAG5273_Handle_t *pHandle, uint8_t new_addr) {
    if (new_addr < 0x08 || new_addr > 0x77)
        return 3;
    uint8_t reg_val = (new_addr << 1) | 0x01;
    uint8_t result = TMAG5273_WriteRegister(pHandle, 0x0C, reg_val);
    if (result == 0) {
        pHandle->address = new_addr; // update handle's address
    }
    return result;
}
```

I had some trouble using it at first, but turns out, I had to initialize the sensor, and then use it. bruh.

After getting the main loop working with all 25 sensors, it was magic. The lights were pwm controlled by how far the magnet was on each key. It was amazing.

I had to implement a value that would normal the resting sensor values as some would be too close to the sensor. It was some neat logic that works flawlessly.

# August 1st: Velocity and Octave Change

<img width="1687" height="556" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-01 175933" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee60559a-1c8f-489e-938c-f264c5f7e4d7" />

My original velocity sensing code was a bit finicky and wasn't actually measuring the time between two points. I updated it now to be more reliable and mapped to a realistic curve.

I noticed that there was some sort of latency with the sensors, so I edited the system clock speed in cubemx from 64 to 400. I didn't notice any change though.

<img width="690" height="456" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/408edfb5-f9aa-488b-a3dc-0a558494a9ad" />

Finally, I added a way to change the octave by holding two keys for 3 seconds to turn on octave mode. It took quite a while to add this feature in, but made the user experience so much better.

All the timing was based on `HAL_GetTick()` and was a little hard to think about. It was like pressing tap on a stopwatch and measuring that time from there. The last problem I had while trying to implement this mode was getting out of it. It would move an octave up or down as the keys used to get into octave mode were also reused to go up or down an octave. To fix this, I had to put a delay of 200ms to check if both keys were pressed.

# August 2nd: MPE Protocol Implementation + Finished!!! 

The MPE MIDI protocol is an extension of the regular midi protocol, so it was quite easy to convert a midi device to a mpe midi device. I created `mpe.c` to have all the mpe based functions all in one place. The only difference was that every note had its own channel and there was a bit more logic to make that happen. Those channels can then be sent extra data like aftertouch and per key pitch change.

<img width="1433" height="380" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-02 200215" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/223f187d-a0a4-469d-8937-9c4dd1cabc51" />

At first, most of my pitch change calculations were relatively based on an arbitrary angle that isn't shared by all of the hall effect sensors. This would cause some keys to have a bias to be pitched more up or down than usual. I solved this by storing the keys first angle from its first actuation. 

The only caveaut to this is that the user may not press the key flat at first which create a bad reference for later calculations.

<img width="1528" height="461" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5289549-4666-403a-9b75-796a64abe308" />

After finally setting up a ton logic that would make the per key pitch feel more intuitive, it felt like magic. It felt so surreal that I was making music as expressive as this.

Aftertouch was then added as it was pretty easy to do. A ton of calculations for the pitch, velocity, and aftertouch also depended on if the key was white or black as the flexures acted differently.

I still cant believe I actually made this. Its like in the Roli and Expressive E commercials. I managed to make my first midi controller that works well enough with capabilities of controllers costing upwards of $2k.

Thank you Hack Club for funding this.
